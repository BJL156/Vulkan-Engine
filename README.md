# Vulkan-Engine
A small Vulkan engine so I can learn Vulkan.

# About
This project isn't being created for the use game development or any real use. This is due to the no build system and the repository being just a Visual Studio 2022 solution file.
This repository was made as connection between my laptop's version and my desktop's version of this engine (I got sick of uploading new .zip files to Google Drive). Addtionally, it's used so in school I can look at the code to review what I wrote the previous night.

# Credits
This would not at all be possible without the help of both:
- [Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/) by [Alexander Overvoorde](https://github.com/Overv)
- [Vulkan (C++) Game Engine Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8327DO66nu9qYVKLDmdLW_84-yE4auCR) by [Brendan Galea](https://www.youtube.com/@BrendanGalea)

The code isn't a carbon copy of these tutorials, but there is a lot of inspiration and help from the both.
